  My name is Alyssa and I am a recent graduate of the Illinois Institute of Art- Schaumburg. I am a graphic designer and illustrator with experience in print production, collateral, and multi-media design.

  I frequently incorporate elements of motion and interactivity in my designs providing my viewers with a fun and engaging experience. While I am most interested in designing for a deserving cause and social reform, no job is too big or too small.

  With that... let's make great design!
